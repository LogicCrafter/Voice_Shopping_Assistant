## Approach (<=200 words)
We built a minimalist voice-first shopping assistant with comprehensive cost management. The frontend uses the browser's Web Speech API to capture speech with live feedback. A lightweight NLP layer extracts intents (add/remove/search), quantities, costs, and price filters for both English and Hindi keywords. The backend stores items in MongoDB with cost tracking, calculates total shopping list costs, and exposes seasonal recommendations and substitutes. Search runs against a demo in-memory catalog but can be swapped with any provider. Items are auto-categorized via a simple map. The UI includes cost input fields, budget tracking with visual indicators, and total cost display. The cost feature supports voice commands like "add milk for 50 rupees" and provides real-time budget monitoring. The code is production-ready for a small demo: MVC structure, error handling, environment-based URLs, and clean React state updates.
